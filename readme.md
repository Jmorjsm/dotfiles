## Overview
![Windows Terminal using these dotfiles](./assets/windows-terminal-screenshot.png)
- Focused on configuring my Windows development environment, but will be adding support for other platforms.
- Installs using a simple powershell script.
- Makes a backup of each file that's copied. Will be possible to restore from a backup (eventually).

## Installation
Clone the repo, run the script.

```
git clone https://github.com/jmorjsm/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles/
. ./install.ps1
```
